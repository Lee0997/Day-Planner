# Description

The day planner is a tool I created in order to help a user manage their day through the use of time slots and text blocks. It uses mostly core javascript and HTML with bootstrap to aid the layout of the page. 

## _Here's a little preview of the page!_

# Tests

I tested the application gradually during the development by using dev tools to check if my local storage and console logs were running correctly as I added code.

# Description

The day planner is a tool I created in order to help a user manage their day through the use of time slots and text blocks. It uses mostly core javascript and HTML with bootstrap to aid the layout of the page. 

# Installation

To use the Day Planner one simply needs to open the page at https://lee0997.github.io/Day-Planner/ 

# Credits

Created by myself @Lee0997

# Features

Clock, Save functionality, clear all and task storage

# Tests

I tested the application gradually during the development by using dev tools to check if my local storage and console logs were running correctly as I added code.
